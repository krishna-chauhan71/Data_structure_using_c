# 📚 Data Structures Repository

Welcome to the **Data Structures** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of **C language** programs that demonstrate the core principles and implementation techniques of data structures. Designed with learning and revision in mind, this repository is a collaborative effort by computer science students to master and share the most essential topics in Data Structures.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is created with the following objectives:

- ✅ To build a strong foundation in Data Structures.
- ✅ To provide well-commented, clean, and tested code examples for academic reference.
- ✅ To assist students in preparing for college exams, coding rounds, and technical interviews.
- ✅ To foster collaborative learning by contributing and reviewing code.
- ✅ To act as a centralized place for all DS programs covered in our curriculum.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or someone preparing for a placement drive, this repository can be your go-to resource.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

By going through this repository, learners will:

- Understand how each data structure works internally.
- Learn to write efficient code in C language.
- Gain confidence in solving problems related to arrays, trees, graphs, and more.
- Prepare for real-world programming challenges and competitive coding.
